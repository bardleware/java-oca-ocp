### Using Operators and Decision Constructs
  * Use Java Operators
  * Use parentheses to override operator precedence
  * Test equality between strings and other objects using `==` and `equals()`
  * Use a `switch` statement
### Creating and Using Arrays
  * Declare, instantiate, initialize and use a one-dimensional array

  * Determine when casting is necessary
  * Use `super` and `this` to access objects and constructors
  * Use abstract classes and interfaces
### Handling exceptions
  * Differentiate among checked exceptions, `RuntimeException`, and `Error`
  * Create a `try-catch` block and determine how exceptions alter normal program flow
  * Describe what exceptions are used for in Java
